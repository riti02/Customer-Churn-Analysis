- **Service usage patterns** affecting churn  
- **Financial impact of churn** on the business  
- **Potential strategies** to reduce churn  

### 🛠 **Power BI Features Used**  
To make this dashboard insightful and interactive, I have used various **Power BI tools and techniques**, including:  
✔️ **Power Query** for data transformation and cleaning  
✔️ **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to calculate churn rates and KPIs  
✔️ **Slicers & Filters** for interactive data exploration  
✔️ **Custom Visualizations** including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs  
✔️ **Drill-through & Tooltips** to provide deeper insights into customer data
